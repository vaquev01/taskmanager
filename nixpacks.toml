# Note: In Nixpacks/Alpine/some distros it varies, but defining it helps. 
# However, relying on PATH is safer if we can. 
# Let's simple enable Chromium. Nix usually links it.
# Getting usage path dynamically is harder in TOML.
# Let's try without forcing CHROME_BIN path first, or use a command to find it.
